        <h2>What is MindMeld?</h2>
        <p>
          MindMeld is a web-based mind mapping tool that allows users to create,
          organize, and connect notes in a flexible, freeform manner.
        </p>

        <h2>Where did it come from?</h2>
        <p>
          I'm writing a <a href="https://teamcraft.uk">book</a>. My co-author,
          Andrew, and I are currently about 80,000 words (or 400 pages) of
          content into the manuscript, and ahead of one of our weekly calls I
          decided that I wanted to sketch out the current structure visually. If
          I had a white board, it would be full of post-its, but in the absence
          of that, I needed a digital tool to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know what you're thinking. Miro, Lucidchart, Diagrams.net, even
          Figma or Google Slides already exist. But I wanted something simple -
          just some notes on a canvas. I had a pretty clear idea what I wanted
          it to do too, but simplicity was absolutely the goal. Just notes, and
          a canvas. Mindmeld is what happened when I decided to write my own
          app, with the help of ChatGPT and Claude.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Use MindMeld</h2>
        <p>
          MindMeld is intentionally simple with only very basic functionality,
          running entirely in a browser. You can't use it with other users in
          real time, and there's no online storage of your maps. They need to be
          exported and imported as JSON files.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get started, double-click anywhere on the canvas to create a new
          note. You can then move notes by clicking and dragging them, and
          connect notes by dragging from one ghost connector to another note.
        </p>

        <h2>Working with Data</h2>
        <p>
          Since the data is exported as JSON, you can try entering the exported
          data into a large language model (LLM) like Claude, GPT, or Gemini.
          These models can take your maps and create prose from them. It can
          take your maps and create prose from them, (eg, "create me a book
          summary from this JSON...") or, even create JSON in the correct format
          from an existing book ("convert the major themes of this book into
          JSON in this format...") [see the readme for more details]
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Schema Explanation</h2>
        <p>
          You can use this explanation in a prompt to an LLM to help it parse
          your clipboard or exported JSON files.
        </p>
        <p>
          The JSON defines a diagram with two main components: "notes" (n) and
          "connections" (c).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Notes (n):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>ID (i): Unique base-62 identifier, starting at "1".</li>
          <li>Position (p): Array with x and y coordinates on the canvas.</li>
          <li>Content (c): Text or label of the note.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Connections (c):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Array with three elements:</li>
          <li>From ID: &apos;i&apos; value of the starting note.</li>
          <li>To ID: &apos;i&apos; value of the ending note.</li>
          <li>
            Type: Integer representing the connection type (e.g., directional).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This structure maps relationships between notes on a canvas, with
          notes positioned by coordinates and connected by defined
          relationships.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Data</h2>
        <p>
          No data is stored anywhere except in your browser. There are no
          cookies, and no information is sent to a server. This ensures your
          data remains private and secure while you work on your mind maps.
          <strong>Rememember</strong> you have to export your work to save it.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Running Your Own Copy</h2>
        <p>
          You can download the Mindmeld files from
          <a href="https://github.com/maudlin/mindmeld">Github</a> and run
          MindMeld from your own server or even locally on your own laptop. This
          provides you with complete control over your mind mapping environment
          and allows for offline usage.

        <h2>No Warranty</h2>
        <p>
          The application code is provided with no warranty whatsoever. It's a
          demonstration of an app that can be created purely with generative AI
          tools. While it is fully functional, it is intended to showcase what
          can be achieved with AI and may not have the robustness of a
          commercial product. Use it at your own risk.
