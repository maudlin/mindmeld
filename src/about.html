        <h2>What is MindMeld?</h2>
        <p>
          MindMeld is a web-based mind mapping tool that allows users to create,
          organize, and connect notes in a flexible, freeform manner. Created
          collaboratively by ChatGPT and Claude under the guidance of Mark
          Ridley, it helps users visually map out their ideas and relationships
          between them.

        <h2>How to Use MindMeld</h2>
        <p>
          MindMeld is intentionally simple with basic functionality, running
          entirely in a browser. You can't use it with other users, and there's
          no state storage of your maps. They need to be exported and imported
          as JSON files.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get started, double-click anywhere on the canvas to create a new
          note. You can then move notes by clicking and dragging them, and
          connect notes by dragging from one ghost connector to another note.
        </p>

        <h2>Working with Data</h2>
        <p>
          Since the data is exported as JSON, you can try entering the exported
          data into a large language model (LLM) like Claude, GPT, or Gemini.
          These models can take your maps and create prose from them. It can
          take your maps and create prose from them, (eg, "create me a book
          summary from this JSON...") or, even create JSON in the correct format
          from an existing book ("convert the major themes of this book into
          JSON in this format...") [see the readme for more details]
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Your Data</h2>
        <p>
          No data is stored anywhere except in your browser. There are no
          cookies, and no information is sent to a server. This ensures your
          data remains private and secure while you work on your mind maps.
          <strong>Rememember</strong> you have to export your work to save it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Running Your Own Copy</h2>
        <p>
          You can download the Mindmeld files from GitHub and run MindMeld from
          your own server or even locally on your own laptop. This provides you
          with complete control over your mind mapping environment and allows
          for offline usage.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>No Warranty</h2>
        <p>
          The application code is provided with no warranty whatsoever. It's a
          demonstration of an app that can be created purely with generative AI
          tools. While it is fully functional, it is intended to showcase what
          can be achieved with AI and may not have the robustness of a
          commercial product. Use it at your own risk.
